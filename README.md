# Python Container Action Template

This is a template for creating GitHub actions and contains a small Python application which will be built into a minimal [Container Action](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action). Our final container from this template is ~50MB, yours may be a little bigger once you add some code. If you want something smaller check out my [go-container-action template](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/go-container-action/actions).

In `main.py` you will find a small example of accessing Action inputs and returning Action outputs. For more information on communicating with the workflow see the [development tools for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/development-tools-for-github-actions).

## Requirments

        id: alerts
        uses: spicyparrot/check-dependabot@v1            
        with:
          github_personal_token: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_ACCESS_TOKEN }}  

      - name: Check Open Alerts
        run: |
          test "${{ steps.alerts.outputs.total_alerts }}" == "0"
